-------------
Szilva:
    - Experimenting with VarDictJava: it is a bit tricky to start, but not that bad. There are issues with 
      postfiltering (using differnet sort of R scritps) and the VCF format.  
    - Pelin suggested to check the BCBIO script that makes VCF from its output - it is there, though is a rather 
      obfuscated Perl stuff
    - Please have a look at https://www.zenhub.io/ - it is a Trello-like stuff for github, maybe we can avoid double
      bookkeeping using this.

Pelin:
    - if I followed correctly (please clear up if not) had a asked Jesper about the involvement, and we should find 
      out whether the newly recruited people from KI and/or GU are willing to go into this and write the corresponding parts

Pall:
    - had problems with NF when joining two flows. Seems most of the struggle is over, now we can have joined flows
    - have to have a refined workflow chart with clear inputs and outputs to continue

Malin:
    - trying to get ASCAT running on a real sample on Milou and it will take some more days before having results to show you.


Malin and Pall will be on a retreat for the rest of the week, we have agreed to postpone the hardware meeting to next week.
There was no meeting regarding the Genomics England guy in Uppsala; hoping they will make it eventually. Until that we
have to live with their http://www.opencb.org/ page that has rather little information about hardware considerations.



Minutes of the stakeholders' meeting on 29 March 2016
-----------------------------------------------------
(Max gave a general overview, Szilva few slides about the tools used, see presentation Max upladed o Google drive)

Björn: details about what NBIS/WABI is

Malin:
- ASCAT gives us information about ploidity and sample heterogeneity
- in fact it gives an estimate about ploidity for each chromosome
- details about resources needed to run MuTect2

Susanne Fransson:
- neuroblastoma: not in the CNS, tumor or peripherial NS
- different stages: different genomic profiles of patients
- MYC copy gain many cases
- they certainly want to have SV included into the pipeline
- Why NGS? 
    - to refine the picture, find things that are not possible with MA only
- 15 cases/y
- looking for classification, find actionable SVs as a research project, not for clinical diagnosis

Monica Nister, Teresita Díaz De Ståhl:
- national biobank to get all the solid childhood tumor samples
- it is still a research topic
- 200 cases/year
- no improvement in the last 20 years
- as before, they are going to build up a set of actionable mutations once there is data analyzed
- they already have a workflow where NGS is only a brick
- not only the difference in tumor/normal, but the germline mutations are needed (practically
    everything, as these can lead to disease, and there is no clear picture yet)
- there are some samples sequenced already (WES)
- they are using GATK-BP, also other tools like SNPEff, Provean, SIFT, VarScan
- for children there are 0-50 somatic mutations (there are 1000s for adults)

Other topic mentioned:
- annotations should be delivered later
- benchmarking needed, especially for SV
    - Tommy Martinsson has a fairly good SV benchmark data, though my understanding was that most of the
    data they have is microarray
- MN suggests we should bring in other groups doing cancer research (especially from clinics)
- actually everybody agrees that we should collaborate more with clinics
- MN: it would be nice to have methylation and RNA-Seq data also
- it is not even clear whether NGS is necessary, this is one thing to find out

* Seems all the groups are in a need of general bioinformatics support.
* Storage space is already an issue (and certainly will be even more important in the future)
* Although the main goal is not to have a routine clinical cancer NGS workflow next month, the
general direction is towards something that can be used in hospitals ASAP.
* We have to have channels for communication (besides email - can/should we use slack?)
* They are happy with having VCF/BAM files as result by now
