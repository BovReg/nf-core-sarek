Max: organized a meeting to Valtteri - Tue 10:00 Gamma
Hackathon: Tue 11:00 - Wednesday (26/27 Apr)

It was now pretty short meeting as Pall is on hold and Malin on
training. I have included Joel, Phil and Rickard as there are notes
about the Oslo meeting in the Google doc folder - please extend it if
you have anything to add:

The other general thing is that we agreed on to have a hackathon next
week Tuesday and Wednesday to finish the NextFlow / Variant Call /
whatever left for sprint 1 in CAW.

Maxime is getting familiar with the code Pall we have already during the week.

12 April 2016
-------------
Malin: 
    - read group (RG) information for VC should be inserted into the WF (NGI pipeline is handling this some way)
    - merging VCFs: while MuTect2 and VarDict is providing a somatic call, for FreeBayes we have to filter/merger ourselves
    - if we have the filtered VCFs, we still have to decide what to provide for clinicians
    - next week she will not be available most of the time due to teaching duties
    - ASCAT runs for ages, have to make a small test set that can be run in a reasonable time
    - TODO: have a look at the workflow chart, and extend it with some of the VC options

Pall:
    - the basic WF is working, it can be easily run on milou, the final VC steps needs to be better defined
    in the flowchart with inputs and outputs
    - on hold until further decisions (Max have to have a talk with Björn, 

Pelin:
    - TODO: 
        - discuss things with Jesper and his KI supervisors about his involvement in SV calling (Jesper is willing to 
        contribute, but decision have to be made about his commitments)
        - try to find a more suitable sprint meeting time

Szilva:
    - trying to add configurable items to NF, 
    - workflow description
    - PCM seminar (TODO: finish report and circulate)
    - TODO: be involved in the "Hello World" (simplistic NGI pipeline engine connected to LIMS) with Phil and Denis
Max:
    - TODO: 
        - Maxime has started working somewhere, provide a desk for him, arrange card and other necessities for him
        - ask Monica about his time commitments, and laptop 

Other things:
    - Clinical Genomics already have a pipeline from FASTQ to VCF/Annotations called MEB / Scout 
        - Max is organizing a meeting for next Friday after lunch if confirmed
    - Oslo: 
        - it is an informal meeting trying to sneak into things they have, and provide information 
        about our system
        - would be nice to know about their experience with the used VCs
    - Malin and Pall already spent 100 hours on this project out of 200 - Max has to discuss with Björn about the
    continuation
    - we already have WGS data from Monica and Theresita to be processed, so we can try to run them once things are ready
    - workflow bubbles: we should make the workflow chart in a way that 
        - I/O can be well defined for compartments
        - persons responsible for the actual parts can be identified
        - spend more time on connecting nodes and tasks instead of simply coding

Infrastructure:
    - we have irma for production, and we should be able to run system testing on it
    - not for development though: only mature, tested (on milou) WFs
    - right now the setup for irma is limited
    - Szilva have to have a talk to Francesco about the possible usage and limitations
        - bring in Phil as eventually RNA-Seq should also be put on irma
    - if irma is OK, then
        - development on milou (that is a bottleneck already)
        - clinical data on their own HW
        - we still can use amanita and picea
        - we have to have big test runs on a less crowded server
    - we need a test set for multi-line data
        - Francesco already provided a script to mimic directory structure generated by NGI 
        (https://github.com/NationalGenomicsInfrastructure/ngi_pipeline/blob/master/scripts/NGI_pipeline_test.py)
        but all the centers are delivering their data in a different structure
        - it is hard to fake a multi-lane data from a single-lane test set
    - entry point of the workflow should be a single, hand-made config/yaml file that is picked up by the pipeline
        - qualifiers like germline, primary, metastatic tumor, concentrations, etc should be stored here
        - LIMS generates this file now for NGI - we have to define our own config

    - how to transfer our work to Valtteri / clinics?
    - we have bought a cluster for them, so we have to discuss its usage also
    - Tommy Martinsson's group already have a CLC cluster (though we do not know whether it is a cluster or a server)
    - they are planning to sequence ~200 samples/year at NGI

Szilva's unorganized thoughts:
    - Something similar was done at ENA: doi:10.1093/nar/gkn765 :
    - separate reads, assemblies and annotations in your architecture
    - make submission/upload easy
        - individuals are responsible for their own submissions
        - make additions/changes easy in the system containing data already submitted
        - large-scale submitters have to use different ways
    - rule-based system to organize data (practically searchable keywords)
    - study - experiment - sample - run hierarchy
    - hybrid file-database system (metadata in database, data on disks/tapes)

Other considerations
    - space: 
        - machines are big, noisy, heating up the lab and eating up eletricity
        - data storage: get NAS instead of individual disks
        - 1T per WGS is the estimate + few Ts stcratch for processing
    - backup: 
        - what are you loosing if your sequencer is lost? you can buy an other one
        - what are you loosing if your data has gone? impossible/difficult to regenerate it
    - ethical issues: you have think about a _very_ restricted access 
    - bandwidth: copying 100T data (200 samples) on a 10MB/s link will take 4 months (10T, 20 samples: 2 weeks)
    - IT support: hardware, software and networking - you will need a full time Linux admin to solve all the issues 
    if you have hundreds of WGS samples

-------------
Szilva:
    - Experimenting with VarDictJava: it is a bit tricky to start, but not that bad. There are issues with 
      postfiltering (using differnet sort of R scritps) and the VCF format.  
    - Pelin suggested to check the BCBIO script that makes VCF from its output - it is there, though is a rather 
      obfuscated Perl stuff
    - Please have a look at https://www.zenhub.io/ - it is a Trello-like stuff for github, maybe we can avoid double
      bookkeeping using this.

Pelin:
    - if I followed correctly (please clear up if not) had a asked Jesper about the involvement, and we should find 
      out whether the newly recruited people from KI and/or GU are willing to go into this and write the corresponding parts

Pall:
    - had problems with NF when joining two flows. Seems most of the struggle is over, now we can have joined flows
    - have to have a refined workflow chart with clear inputs and outputs to continue

Malin:
    - trying to get ASCAT running on a real sample on Milou and it will take some more days before having results to show you.


Malin and Pall will be on a retreat for the rest of the week, we have agreed to postpone the hardware meeting to next week.
There was no meeting regarding the Genomics England guy in Uppsala; hoping they will make it eventually. Until that we
have to live with their http://www.opencb.org/ page that has rather little information about hardware considerations.



Minutes of the stakeholders' meeting on 29 March 2016
-----------------------------------------------------
(Max gave a general overview, Szilva few slides about the tools used, see presentation Max upladed o Google drive)

Björn: details about what NBIS/WABI is

Malin:
- ASCAT gives us information about ploidity and sample heterogeneity
- in fact it gives an estimate about ploidity for each chromosome
- details about resources needed to run MuTect2

Susanne Fransson:
- neuroblastoma: not in the CNS, tumor or peripherial NS
- different stages: different genomic profiles of patients
- MYC copy gain many cases
- they certainly want to have SV included into the pipeline
- Why NGS? 
    - to refine the picture, find things that are not possible with MA only
- 15 cases/y
- looking for classification, find actionable SVs as a research project, not for clinical diagnosis

Monica Nister, Teresita Díaz De Ståhl:
- national biobank to get all the solid childhood tumor samples
- it is still a research topic
- 200 cases/year
- no improvement in the last 20 years
- as before, they are going to build up a set of actionable mutations once there is data analyzed
- they already have a workflow where NGS is only a brick
- not only the difference in tumor/normal, but the germline mutations are needed (practically
    everything, as these can lead to disease, and there is no clear picture yet)
- there are some samples sequenced already (WES)
- they are using GATK-BP, also other tools like SNPEff, Provean, SIFT, VarScan
- for children there are 0-50 somatic mutations (there are 1000s for adults)

Other topic mentioned:
- annotations should be delivered later
- benchmarking needed, especially for SV
    - Tommy Martinsson has a fairly good SV benchmark data, though my understanding was that most of the
    data they have is microarray
- MN suggests we should bring in other groups doing cancer research (especially from clinics)
- actually everybody agrees that we should collaborate more with clinics
- MN: it would be nice to have methylation and RNA-Seq data also
- it is not even clear whether NGS is necessary, this is one thing to find out

* Seems all the groups are in a need of general bioinformatics support.
* Storage space is already an issue (and certainly will be even more important in the future)
* Although the main goal is not to have a routine clinical cancer NGS workflow next month, the
general direction is towards something that can be used in hospitals ASAP.
* We have to have channels for communication (besides email - can/should we use slack?)
* They are happy with having VCF/BAM files as result by now
